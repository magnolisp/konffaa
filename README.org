Konffaa, a lightweight configuration manager originally created for
the ContextLogger2 project.

Konffaa includes a =konffaa= command-line program and a =konffaa=
language. The former is invoked with a variant specification expressed
in the latter, and include files reflecting the chosen variant are
then generated in a variety of languages, for interoperability with
different build managers and scripts.

Some details can be found in the [[http://magnolisp.github.io/konffaa/][manual]].
