Konffaa, a lightweight configuration manager originally created for
the ContextLogger2 project.

The idea is simple: you choose a single configuration (from under a
"variants" directory), passing its filename on the command line. The
=konffaa= program will then proceed to generate a bunch of include
files that reflect the configuration. The include files are only
touched when they actually change as a result of the change in
configuration; this is to allow Konffaa to better work with build
managers (such as Make) whose dependency checking is based on
timestamps.
